## Overview

A few short paragraphs on the product and what it does. (Keep to an external user view)

#### Supported Architectures

Currently, we provide pre-built xxxx binaries for Windows, Linux, macOS (Darwin), other....

xxxx may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including Plan 9 and Solaris.

**Complete documentation is available at [xxxx Documentation](https://xxxx/getting-started/).**

## Choose How to Install
(install binary option).
(note any external dependencies for binaries).

To contribute to the xxxx source code or documentation, you should [fork the xxxx GitHub project](https://github.com/NSIP/xxxx#fork-destination-box) and clone it to your local machine.

Finally, you can install xxxx source code with `go`, build the binaries yourself, and run xxxx that way.
Building the binaries is an easy task for an experienced `go` getter.

### Install xxxx (Binary Install)

Use the [installation instructions in the xxxx documentation](https://xxxx/getting-started/installing/).

### Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install)

#### Prerequisite Tools

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Go (we test it with the last 2 major versions)](https://golang.org/dl/)

#### Fetch from GitHub

xxxx uses the Go Modules support built into Go 1.11 to build. The easiest is to clone xxxx in a directory outside of `GOPATH`, as in the following example:

```bash
mkdir $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
git clone https://github.com/xxxx/xxxx.git
cd xxxx
go install
```

**If you are a Windows user, substitute the `$HOME` environment variable above with `%USERPROFILE%`.**
